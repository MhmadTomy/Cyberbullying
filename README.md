Cyberbullying is one of the problems found on 
social media, and Twitter is no exception. Especially in 
Indonesia, cyberbullying is a concern because of the large 
number of bullying on social media, posing a risk to young 
people. Detection of cyberbullying is an essential step 
towards creating a suitable environment for interacting on 
social media. This study was conducted to classify posts on 
social media, especially Twitter, to identify cyberbullying 
on social media. In this study, two methods were used to
compare the results to find the best method between the 
two methods. The first method is Long Short Term 
Memory (LSTM) with 91% accuracy and Naive Bayes 
Multinomial with 92% accuracy
